ALICE:_Che-shire Pus-sy, thanks to thee,
for the things you've told to me.
You've such in-for-ma-tion rare,
No cat with you can com-pare
How I wish my Di-nah too
could con-verse as well as you,
for, your ans-wers come so pat;
You're a won-drous Che-shire Cat.

BOTH:_For- your- ans-wers come so pat,
You're- a- won-drous Che-shire Cat.
For- your- ans-wers come so pat,
You're a won-drous Che-shire Cat.

CAT:_A-lice, you're ex-treme-ly kind,
Thus to praise my ac-tive mind,
Let your Di-nah to me come
at a rea-son-a-ble sum.
I will teach her all I know,
Make her man-ners 'comme il faut'.
Till folks mar-vel what I'm at,
I'm a won-drous Che-shire Cat.

BOTH:_Till- folks- mar-vel what I'm at,
I'm- a- won-drous Che-shire Cat.
Till- folks- mar-vel what I'm at,
I'm a won-drous Che-shire Cat.
