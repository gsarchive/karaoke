HARE:_The poor Hat-ter's ve-ry mad,
So they say, so they say.
He's in-du-bi-ta-bly mad, so they say.
Tho' why hat-ters should be mad, dear,
Is a puz-zle un-to me, dear,
But they are mad, all a-gree, dear, so they say.
So they say, so they say, so they say.

HATTER:_Hares in March are ve-ry queer,
So they say, so they say.
And the rea-sons ve-ry clear, so they say.
They are sane all throâ€™ the Au-tumn
But when Spring-tide winds have caught 'em
Ve-ry mad the world has thought 'em, so they say.
So they say, so they say, so they say.

ALICE:_He is ve-ry bad in March,
So they say, so they say.
And he lives on soap and starch, so they say.
He is mad and so's the hat-ter,
But I do not mean to flat-ter,
When I say it does not mat-ter, so they say.
So they say, so they say, so they say.
