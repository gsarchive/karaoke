Sound the fest-al trum-pets, set the bells a-ring-ing,
Here are cur-ried crum-pets, cro-co-diles and beans.-
Raise on high the cha-lice in all hon-or sing-ing,
Wel-come, wel-come, A-lice with the no-ble Queens.
Wel-come, wel-come, A-lice with the no-ble Queens,
Wel-come, wel-come, A-lice with the no-ble Queens,
Wel-come, wel-come, A-lice with the no-ble Queens,
Wel-come, wel-come, A-lice with the no-ble Queens.
