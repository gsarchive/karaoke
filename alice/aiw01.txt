Sleep, A-lice, sleep as we cir-cle a-round thee,
Lull'd by the mu-sic of bird and of bee:
Safe in the fo-rest, since fai-ries have found thee,
Here where we come to keep tryst by the tree.
Sleep, A-lice, sleep, these are ma-gi-cal num-bers,
Songs that are learned from the mount and the stream.
Ours be the task to keep watch o'er thy slum-bers,
Wake, A-lice, wake to the Won-der-land Dream.

Wake, A-lice, wake!
Wake, A-lice, wake,
A-lice!
A-lice!
Wake to the Won-der-land Dream!

Sleep, A-lice, sleep as we cir-cle a-round thee,
Lull'd by the mu-sic of bird and of bee:
Safe in the fo-rest, since fai-ries have found thee,
Here where we come to keep tryst by the tree.
Sleep, A-lice, sleep, these are ma-gi-cal num-bers,
Songs that are learned from the mount and the stream.
Ours be the task to keep watch o'er thy slum-bers,
Wake, A-lice, wake to the Won-der-land Dream.
