How doth the lit--tle cro--co-dile
Im-prove his shi--ning tail,-
And pour the wa--ters of- the Nile-
On ev--'ry gol--den scale.-

How cheer-ful-ly- he seems- to grin
And neat--ly spreads- his claws-
And wel-come lit-tle fish--es in-
With gent--ly smi--ling jaws.-

How doth the lit--tle cro--co-dile
Im-prove his shi--ning tail,-
And pour the wa--ters of- the Nile
On ev-'ry gol-den scale.
