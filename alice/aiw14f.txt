Tell me why you look so wild and strange,
Won't you try to smile just for a change?
For I'm not a-shamed to own,
Half a-fraid of you I've grown.
Tell me Hat-ter,
What's the mat-ter,
Now that we're a-lone.

Say you on-ly meant to tease me,
For you've made me sad.
Won't you whis-per just to please me,
You're- not- real-ly mad.

I'm a-fraid your work is all in vain,
For I'm sure you real-ly can't be sane.
All these an-tics you go thro'
All the fool-ish things you do
Can't de-ceive me,
On-ly leave me,
More dis-tressed for you.

Let me sooth you, poor mad Hat-ter,
Do please, let me try.
Poor mad Hat-ter, what's the mat-ter?
You'll be bet-ter bye and bye.
