Here we go round the Mul-ber-ry bush,
the Mul-ber-ry bush, the Mul-ber-ry bush.
Here we go round the Mul-ber-ry bush,
On a cold and frost-y morn-ing.

wash our hands,- wash our hands.
This is the way we wash our hands
On a cold and frost-y morn-ing.

This is the way we go to school,
we go to school, we go to school.
This is the way we go to school,
On a cold and frost-y morn-ing.

Here we go round the Mul-ber-ry bush,
the Mul-ber-ry bush, the Mul-b'ry bush.
Here we go round the Mul-ber-ry bush,
On a cold and frost-y morn-ing.

Here we go round the Mul-ber-ry bush,
the Mul-ber-ry bush, the Mul-b'ry bush.
Here we go round the Mul-ber-ry bush,
On a cold and frost-y morn-ing.
