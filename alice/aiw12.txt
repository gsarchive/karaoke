ALICE:_"Not guil-ty" I de-clare,
But let the Knave take care
In fu-ture not to steal
the tempt-ing tarts
KING:_Not guil-ty, then I fear
You can-not now, my dear,
Be-head for steal-ing
that bad Knave of Hearts.
QUEEN:_Not guil-ty! Oh, it's shock-ing,
Miss A-lice must be mock-ing,
Don't tell me that the tarts them-selves
ran off, and left the shelf!
ALICE:_Yes, that's the view I've ta-ken,
If your nerves, my dear, are sha-ken,
I would ven-ture to ad-vise you
just to ex-e-cute your-self.
CHILDREN:_Yes, that's the view we've ta-ken,
And if your nerves are sha-ken,
We would ven-ture to ad-vise you
just to ex-e-cute your-self.
Yes, that's the view we've ta-ken,
If your nerves, my dear, are sha-ken,
We would ven-ture to ad-vise you
just to ex-e-cute your-self.
Yes, ex-e--cute your-self.

ALL:_It's ve-ry hard u-pon the Queen of Hearts
Who vowed the Knave stole tarts;-
To find that Knave by ver-dict of one friend
"Not guil-ty" in the end.
Not guil-ty, not- guil-ty, not guil-ty- in the end.
Not guil-ty, not guil-ty, not guil-ty in the end.
It's ve-ry hard u-pon the Queen of Hearts

"Not guil-ty" in the end.

Not guil-ty we de-clare.
But let the Knave take care,
In fu-ture from the tarts to keep his hand.
Not guil-ty! now we know
Why these strange things are so
And why our A-lice came to Won-der-land,
Won-der-land, Why A-lice came- to- Won-der-land.
