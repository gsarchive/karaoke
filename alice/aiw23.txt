A-lice-'s health, Long life and wealth,
Ne-ver a mon-arch so migh-ty was seen.
Gai-ly fill up, Bea-ker and cup,
Drink to our A-lice, our A-lice, our Queen!
A-lice-'s health, A-lice-'s health, A-lice-'s health.
A-lice-'s health, Long life and wealth,
Ne-ver a mon-arch so migh-ty was seen.
Gai-ly fill up, Bea-ker and cup,
Drink to our A-lice, our A-lice, our Queen!

Wake, A-lice, wake now; no long-er a ro-ver,
Fast fade the Won-der-land vi-sions a-way!
Wake at the elves' call, the dream play is o-ver,
Wake, A-lice, wake, to the world of to-day!
Wake at the elves' call, the dream play is o-ver,
Wake, A-lice, wake, to the world of to-day!
Wake at the elves' call, the dream play is o-ver,
Wake, A-lice, wake, to the world of to-day!
