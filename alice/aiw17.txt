The Car-pen-ter is sleep-ing,
the but-ter's on his face.
The vin-e-gar and pep-per
are all a-bout the place.
Let oy-sters rock your cra-dle
and lull you in-to rest.
And if that will not do it,
we'll sit up-on your chest.
We'll sit up-on your chest, oh!---
We'll sit up-on your chest, oh!---
The sim-plest way to do it
is to sit up-on your chest!
