Hump-ty Dump-ty's fal-len down,
Hump-ty Dump-ty, Hump-ty Dump-ty;
Hump-ty Dump-ty's cracked his crown,
Hump-ty Dump-ty.
But the king keeps his pro-mise,
The king keeps his pro-mise, his pro--mise,
The king keeps his pro-mise, though hor-ses and men
Can't put Hump-ty Dump-ty to-ge-ther a-gain
Though all the king's hor-ses and king's men may race,
'Tis clear they can ne-ver re-store to his place,
Hump-ty- Dump-ty, Hump-ty- Dump-ty.
Hump-ty, Hump-ty Dump-ty Dump-ty;
Hump-ty Dump-ty's fal-len down,
Hump-ty Dump-ty's cracked his crown,
Hump-ty Dump-ty, Hump-ty Dump-ty;
Hump-ty Dump-ty's fal-len down,
Hump-ty Dump-ty's cracked his crown.
