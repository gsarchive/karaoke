Here ranged in due or-der of bat-tle we stand,
With Red King and White King and Queens on each hand;
The Bish-ops move side-ways to aid in the fight,
And see how er-rat-ic the course of the Knight;
The Pawns are full pri-vates and both wings to guard,
The four stur-dy Cas-tles keep due watch and ward.
