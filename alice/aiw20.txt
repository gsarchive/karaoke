The Li-on and the U-ni-corn were fight-ing for the Crown.
The Li-on beat the U-ni-corn all round the town!
Some- gave him white- bread and some- gave him brown,
Some gave him plum- cake and drum'd him out of town.
Rat-a-plan, rat-a-plan,
Rat-a-plan, plan, plan, plan, plan.
Rat-a-plan, rat-a-plan,
They drum'd him out of town.
Rat-a-plan, rat-a-plan,
Rat-a-plan, plan, plan, plan, plan.
Some gave him plum cake and drum'd him out of town.
