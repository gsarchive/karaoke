"You are old, Fa-ther Wil-liam," the young- man said,
"And your hair has be-come ve-ry white.
And yet you in-ces-sant-ly stand on your head:
Do you think, at your age, it is right?"

"In my youth," Fa-ther Wil-liam re-plied to his son,
"I feared it might in-jure my brain.-
But now I am per-fect-ly sure I have none,
Why, I do it a-gain and a-gain!"

"You are old," said the youth, "as I men-tioned be-fore,
and have grown most un-com-mon-ly fat.
Yet you turned a back so-mer-sault in at the door:
Pray what is the rea-son of that?"

"In my youth," said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,
"I kept all my limbs ve-ry sup-ple
By the use of this oint-ment, a shil-ling a box:
Pray al-low me to sell you a cou-ple?

Pray al-low me to sell you a cou-ple,
Pray al-low me to sell you a cou-ple,
By the use of this oint-ment, a shil-ling a box:
Pray al-low me to sell you a cou-ple?"
