CHORUS:_'Twas bril-lig and the slith-y toves
Did gyre and gim-ble in the wabe,
All mim-sy were the bor-o-goves
And the mome raths out-grabe!
Out-grabe----

QUEEN:_Be-ware the Jab-ber-wock, my son,
The jaws that bite, the claws that scratch!
Be-ware the ju-jube bird, and shun
the fru-mious Ban-der-snatch!

He took his vor-pal sword in hand:
long time the mas-come foe he sought.
So rest-ed he by the tum tum tree
and stood a-while in- thought.

And as in uf-fish thought he stood,
The Jab-ber-wock with eyes of flame
Came whif-fling- through the tul-gry- wood
and bur-bled as he came.

One, two, one, two, and thro' and- thro'
The vor-pal blade went snick-er-snack.
He left it dead and with its head
he went go-lump-ing back.

And hast thou slain the Jab-ber-wock?
Come to my arms, my beam-ish boy.
O frab-gous day, Cal-loh, Cal-lay!
He chor-tled in his joy.-

CHORUS:_'Twas bril-lig, and the slith-y toves
Did gyre and gim-ble in the wabe,
All mim-sy were the bor-o-goves
And the mome raths out-grabe,
out-grabe.----
