'Tis the voice of the lob-ster
I hear him de-clare,
"You have baked me too brown;
I must su-gar my hair!"
As a duck with its eye-lids,
so he with his nose,
Trims his belt and his but-tons
and turns out his toes.
When the sands are all dry,
he's gay as a lark
And talks in con-temp-tu-ous
tones of the shark.
But when the tide ri-ses
And sharks are a-round-
His voice has a tim-id, tim-id, tim-id,
His voice has a tim-id and trem-u-lous sound.
