When the wind is in the East,
On new-laid eggs I al-ways feast!
When the wind is in the West,
I steal them from the Do-do's nest.
When- the wind is in- the South,
I place a do-zen in my mouth!
When the wind is in the North,
On win-try nights I sal-ly forth!

All the an-i-mals in the Ark,
Come to life when the house is dark,
Cocks and hens, and the owl and crow,
Flap their wings and a-way they go!
Up the pas-sage and down the stairs,
O-ver ta-bles and un-der chairs,
Pigs and pup-pies and po-lar bears,
They fol-low their lead-er round.
