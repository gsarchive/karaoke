King, Queen, and Knave, Here are we seen,
Danc-ing, Danc-ing, so gai-ly on the green.
King, Queen, and Knave, Here we are seen,
So- gay- to--day,- so- gay- to-day- on the green.

Dance a-right in the good old way,
hearts are light- on this our na-tal day
Dance a-right in the good old way,
hearts are light on this our na-tal day.
Dance a-right in the good old way,
hearts are light- on this our na-tal day
Dance a-right in the good old way,
hearts are light on this our na-tal day.

King, Queen, and Knave, Here we are seen,
Danc-ing, Danc-ing so gai-ly on the green,
King, Queen, and Knave, Here we are seen,
So- gay- to--day,- so- gay- to-day- on the green.

Tread a mea-sure here- in this glade,
King, Queen, and A-lice, young- man and maid,
In the wood-land fair- is- one lot,
Gai-ly dance- the- old Ga-votte.
