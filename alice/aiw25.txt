When a rab-bit's- good as gold,
Al-ways does what- he is told,
No-bo-dy can frown or scold,
Life is bright and sun-ny.
But if he should dis-o-bey,
Things are just the o-ther way,
He will hear his par-ents say
Naugh-ty lit-tle bun-ny!
Naugh-ty lit-tle bun-ny!
Wick-ed lit-tle bun-ny!
All in vain he'll squeal and cry
When the big black dog comes by;
Naugh-ty lit-tle bun-ny!
Wick-ed lit-tle bun-ny!
He'll be cook'd for rab-bit pie;
Wretch-ed lit-tle bun-ny!

Lit-tle chil-dren,- if you're wise,
Ne-ver let your- tem-per rise,
Take a hint from rab-bit pies
Do as you are told to.
If you ne-ver dis-o-bey,
Big black dogs won't come your way,
Par-ents smile, and nurse will say
"You're as good as gold, too."
Do as you are told to,
Be as good as gold, too;
Life will be as bright, you'll see,
If you take ad-vice from me;
Do as you are told to,
Be as good as gold, tool;
Think how hap-py you will be;
Do as you are told to!
