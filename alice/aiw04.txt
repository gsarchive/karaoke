Speak rough-ly to your lit-tle boy
and beat him when he snee-zes,
For he can tho-rough-ly en-joy
the pep-per when he plea-ses.

Bow, wow, wow, mew, mew mew,
The pep-per when he plea-ses.
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow,
The pep-per when he plea-ses.

Bow, wow, wow, mew, mew mew,
The pep-per when he plea-ses.
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow,
The pep-per when he plea-ses.
