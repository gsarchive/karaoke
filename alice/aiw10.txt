"Will you walk a lit-tle fast-er,"
said a whi-ting to a snail,
"There's a por-poise close be-hind us,
and he's tread-ing on my tail."
See how ea-ger-ly the lob-sters
and the tur-tles all ad-vance,
They are wait-ing on the shin-gle,
Will you come and join the dance?

Will you, won't you, will you, won't you,
Will you join the dance?
Will you, won't you, will you, won't you,
Come and join the dance?

"You can real-ly have no no-tion,
how de-light-ful it will be
When they take us up and throw us
with the lob-sters out to sea!"
But the snail re-plied, "Too far,
too far," and gave a look ask-ance,
Said he thank'd the whi-ting kind-ly,
But he would not join the dance.

Would not, could not, would not, could not,
Would not join the dance!
Would not, could not, would not, could not,
Could not join the dance!
