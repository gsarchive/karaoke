[Chorus]_The sol-diers of our Queen
Are linked in friend-ly te-ther;
Up-on the bat-tle scene
They fight the foe to-ge-ther.
There ev-'ry mo-ther's son-
Pre-pared to fight and fall is;
The en-em-y of one
The en-em-y of all is!
The en-em-y of one
The en-em-y of all is!

[Colonel]_If you want a re-ceipt for that pop-u-lar mys-ter-y,
Known to the world as a Hea-vy Dra-goon,-------
Take- all the re-mark-a-ble peo-ple in his-tor-y,
Rat-tle them off to a pop-u-lar tune.-------
The pluck of Lord Nel-son on board of the Vic-tor-y;
Gen-ius of Bis-marck de-vis-ing a plan;
The hu-mour of Field-ing (which sounds con-tra-dic-tor-y);
Cool-ness of Pa-get a-bout to tre-pan.
The sci-ence of Jul-lien, the em-i-nent mu-si-co;
Wit of Mac-au-lay, who wrote of Queen Anne;
The pa-thos of Pad-dy, as ren-dered by Bou-ci-cault;
Style of the Bi-shop of So-dor and Man;
The dash of a D'Or-say, di-vest-ed of quack-er-y;
Nar-ra-tive pow-ers of Dick-ens and Thack-er-ay;
Vic-tor Em-man-u-el, peak‐-haunt-ing Pe-ve-ril;
Tho-mas A-qui-nas, and Doc-tor Sa-che-ve-rell;
Tup-per and Ten-n-son, Dan-iel De-foe;
An-tho-ny Trol-lope and Mis-ter Gui-zot!---- Ah!---
Take of these e-le-ments all that is fu-si--ble,
Melt them all down in a pip-kin or cru-ci-ble,
Set them to- sim-mer, and take off the scum,
And a Hea-vy Dra-goon is the- re--si-du-um!

If you want a re-ceipt for this sol-dier‐-like pa-ra-gon,
Get at the wealth of the Czar (if you can);
The fa-mi-ly pride of a Spa-niard from A-ra-gon;
Force of Me-phis-to pro-nounc-ing a ban;
A smack of Lord Wa-ter-ford, reck-less and rol-lick-y;
Swag-ger of Ro-der-ick, head-ing his clan;
The keen pe-ne-tra-tion of Pad-ding-ton Pol-lak-y;
Grace of an O-da-lisque on a di-van;
The ge-nius stra-te-gic of Cae-sar or Han-nib-al;
Skill of Sir Gar-net in thrash-ing a can-ni-bal;
Fla-vour of Ham-let, the Stran-ger, a touch of him;
Lit-tle of Man-fred (but not ve-ry much of him);
Bea-dle of Bur-ling-ton, Ri-chard-son's show;
Mis-ter Mi-caw-ber and Ma-dame Tus-saud!---- Ah!----
Take of these e-le-ments all that is fu-si-ble,
Melt them all down in a pip-kin or cru-ci-ble,
Set them to sim-mer, and take off the scum,
And a Hea-vy Dra-goon is the re-si-du-um!
