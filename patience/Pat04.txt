[Maidens]_In a dole-ful train-
Two and two we walk all day;
For we love in vain! None so sor-row-ful as they
Who- can on--ly sigh and say,
Woe is me, a-lack--a--day!-
Woe is me, a-lack--a--day!

[Dragoons]_Now is not this ri-dic-u-lous, and is not this pre-pos-te-rous?
A tho-rough‐-paced ab-sur-dit-y, ex-plain it if you can.
In-stead of rush-ing ea-ger-ly to che-rish us and fos-ter us,
They all pre-fer this me-lan-chol-y li-te-ra-ry man.
In-stead of sly-ly peer-ing at us,
Cast-ing looks en-dear-ing at us,
Blush-ing at us, flush-ing at us, flirt-ing with a fan;
They're ac-tu-al-ly sneer-ing at us, fleer-ing at us, jeer-ing at us!
Pret-ty sort of treat-ment for a mi-li-ta-ry man!
They're ac-tu-al-ly sneer-ing at us, fleer-ing at us, jeer-ing at us!
Pret-ty sort of treat-ment for a mi-li-ta-ry man!

[Angela]_My-stic po-et, hear our prayer,-
Twen-ty love‐-sick mai-dens we;
Young and weal-thy, dark and fair,
All of coun-ty fa-mi-ly.
And we die for love of thee:
Twen-ty love‐-sick mai-dens we!
[Maidens]_Yes, we die for love of thee:
Twen-ty love‐-sick mai-dens we!

[Bunthorne]_Though my book I seem to scan
In a rapt ec-sta-tic way,
Like a li-te-ra-ry man
Who des-pi-ses fe-male clay,
I hear plain-ly all they say,
Twen-ty love-sick mai-dens they!

[Dragoons]_He hears plain-ly all they say,
Twen-ty love-sick mai-dens they!

[Saphir]_Though so ex-cel-len-tly wise,-
For a mo-ment mor-tal be,
Deign to raise thy pur-ple eyes
From thy heart‐-drawn po-e-sy.
Twen-ty love‐-sick mai-dens see:
Each is kneel-ing on her knee!
[Maidens]_Twen-ty love‐-sick mai-dens see:
Each is kneel-ing on her knee!

[Bunthorne]_Though, as I re-marked be-fore,
A-ny-one con-vinced would be
That some trans-cen-den-tal lore
Is mo-no-po-liz-ing me,
Round the cor-ner I can see
Each is kneel-ing on her knee!

Now is not this ri-di-cu-lous, and is not this pre-pos-te-rous?
A tho-rough‐-paced ab-sur-di-ty, ri-di-cu-lous! pre-pos-te-rous!
Ex-plain it if you can.
