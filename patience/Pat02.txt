---------------------[Patience]_Still brood-ing on their mad_in-fa-tu-a-tion!
I thank thee, Love, thou com-est not to me!
Far hap-pier I, free from thy mi-ni-stra-tion,
Than dukes or duch-ess-es who love can be!
[Saphir]_'Tis Pa-tience, hap--py girl!
Loved by a po-et!
[Patience]_Your par-don la-dies.
I in-trude up-on you.
[Angela]_Nay, pret-ty child, come hi-ther.
Is it true that you have ne-ver loved?
[Patience]_Most true in-deed.
[Chorus]_Most mar-vel-lous!
And most de-plor-a-ble!
[Patience]_I can-not tell what this love may be
That com-eth to all but not to me.
It can-not be kind as they'd im-ply,
Or why do these la-dies sigh?
It can-not be joy- and rap-ture deep,
Or why do these gen-tle la-dies weep?
It can-not be bliss-ful as 'tis said,-
Or why are their eyes so won----drous red?
Though ev--'ry-where- true love I see
A‐-com-ing to all,- but not to me,
I can-not tell what- this love-- may be!
For I- am blithe and I- am gay,
While they- sit sigh--ing night- and day.
For I- am blithe and I- am gay,
Think of the gulf- 'twixt them- and me,
Think of the gulf- 'twixt them- and me,
Fal la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la, and mi-se-rie!
If love is a thorn, they show no wit
Who fool-ish-ly hug and fos-ter it.
If love is a weed, how sim-ple they
Who ga-ther it, day by day!
If love is a net-tle that makes you smart,
Then why do you wear it next your heart?
And if it be none of these, say I,-
Ah, why do you sit and sob--- and sigh?
Though ev--'ry-where- true love I see
A‐-com-ing to all,- but not to me,
I can-not tell what- this love-- may be!
For I- am blithe and I- am gay,
While they- sit sigh--ing night- and day.
For I- am blithe and I- am gay,
Think of the gulf- `twixt them- and me,
Think of the gulf- `twixt them- and me,
Fal la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la, and mi-se-rie!
